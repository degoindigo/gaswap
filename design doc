# Gaswap Doc

## **About Gaswap**

Gaswap is a decentralized exchange committed to building the first on-chain cost management platform through Gas Token.

Gas Token is an ERC20 token, designed as a medium for intertemporal gas trade. Powered by APMM, Gaswap tracks gas price and provides trading services for hedging, speculating, and other onchain cost management demands.

**Note:** APMM is Asymmetric Proactive Market Maker.

## Intro to Gaswap

### How to Participate

### LP

User can provide liquidity to Gaspool to earn transaction fees and LM rewards. 

**Note:** As market fluctuates, LP may bear losses. Gaswap allows LP to rebalance and reset their positions through liquidity management.

### dApp Owner

dApps running on Ethereum consume tons of gas, but as of now, none of them has a tool to manage their costs. All they can do is to upgrade and optimize smart contracts.

Gaswap allows dApp Owners to hedge, predict, and better manage their gas costs (passively or actively), and in the meantime improve UX. We are more than pleased to onboard teams that could develop and deploy hedging strategies and gas-related functions on Gaswap, and we will also provide more gas-related financial tools for 3rd-party protocols to explore in future.

### dApp User

As a user, every interaction with blockchain has a cost. Before Gaswap, users could only load a bunch of native tokens for gas and bear the volatility risks in this regard.

Through Gas Token and Gaswap, dApp users can buy Gas Token in advance to ensure that they can meet their own gas consumption for a certain period of time in the future. And by locking in upfront costs, Gaswap makes intertemporal gas allocation and transaction possible.

### MEV-Bot

For MEV-BOT, the only explicit cost is the gas consumed. Through Gas Token and Gaswap, MEV-Bot can significantly reduce costs and gain a greater competitive advantage. However, it could be even worse off if misjudged the network activities.

### Market Maker

Similar to MEV-Bot, MMs are groups of heavy onchain users. Gaswap significantly reduces MMs’ costs through Gas Token.

### Miner/Stake Validator:

For Miner and Stake Validator, block reward has a time value. From EIP1559 to PoS, block reward has been becoming less and less. And in the absence of fully hedging solutions, Miners and Stake Validators are exposed to greater network activity risk and asset price risk.

### Speculator:

The relationship between the prosperity of network activities and the price of its native tokens is ~~never~~ closely related. Before Gaswap, nobody could speculate on network activities directly. But for now, speculators can speculate on the network activities and thereby realizing different trading strategies.

**Note:** the gas market itself is highly volatile, please use it at your own risk when using leverages.

## Gas Token

### **Overview**

Gas Token is an ERC20 token, designed as a medium for intertemporal gas trade. Powered by APMM, Gaswap tracks gas price and provides trading services for hedging, speculating, and other onchain cost management demands.

### Blockspace

What is blockspace? This is a relatively abstract concept. 

A16z’s head of crypto, Chris Dixon quoted that “blockspace is space on the blockchain that can be used to store information and run code.” Fundamentally, blockspace is the representative unit of a shared layer of computation and state across multiple users; the blockchain exists as a record of changes and additions to this state and crypto networks serve as markets for the production and usage of blockspace.

If you ever believe in a blockchain-driven web3, blockspace is one of the scarce resources. Why? All economic activities on public blockchains settle on blockspace. Consensus producers, such as miners and staking validators, supply blockspace, while every transaction demands blockspace. When on-chain activities increase, network fees increase, and when the value of the block subsidy and fees increase, more people are motivated to compete to append the next block to the blockchain.

Hence, blockspace can be viewed as a new, emerging, critical computing resource alongside traditional computing resources like bandwidth, storage, compute, etc. If the web3 vision plays out, blockspace will probably be the most important new computing resource of the 2020s.

### Consensus market

Since blockspace is a commodity, it can be used as a basis for financial instruments — either to hedge against production or enhance returns. Such financialization ultimately leads to a comprehensive capital market, akin to the way all important commodities have evolved throughout history.

In the blockspace market, ~~miners~~ block builders are the producers, mining pools are the auctioneers, and users are the bidders. The influences of the blockspace market are so pervasive that they touch almost every facet of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

After a user initiates a transaction, it is propagated peer-to-peer in each node’s mempool. Each transaction has a fee attached to it. The fee signals the desire to purchase blockspace, which allows the transaction to be processed and included in a block.

Every moment there are numerous proposed blocks existing in this “Schrödinger's state” between unconfirmed and confirmed, competing to find the first hash output that satisfies the difficulty target. Each block has a probability of becoming the next block. By contributing billions of computations per second, the miners collapse the probability wave and materializes the ledger history.

Since the size of a block is capped, there is a limited number of transactions that can go through at a given time, **thereby giving blockspace an implicit time-value**. A transaction that stays unconfirmed for too long may be subject to market volatility, or get frontrun by arbitrage bots. The fee users pay to purchase blockspace, reflects their willingness to bid for its spacetime. The blockspace market connects the miners and users together.

Primitive forms of financial instruments for blockspace already exist today; hashrate indices, gas tokens, and staking derivatives are all variations of attempts at building consensus capital markets. For example, [Alkimiya](https://alkimiya.io/) is building a Avalanche-based consensus capital market that mirrors the energy swaps found in traditional commodity markets, making the economics of the blockspace accessible to all users. Another example was the [CHI token](https://blog.1inch.io/1inch-introduces-chi-gastoken-d0bd5bb0f92b) launched by 1inch, leveraging [Ethereum storage refund](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) to tokenize gas which had failed after EIP-1559 implementation.

However, above methods failed to attain significant liquidity. These markets were often opaque and onerous to both the seller and buyer.

### Mint Gas Token

There are 3 ways to mint Gas Token:

1. Gaswap provides private discount sales for institutional users or projects with high demands;
2. When adding liquidity, Gas Token can be minted by the proportion of market-making capital ;
3. Gas Token can also be minted through locking (or burning) native tokens. (After exceeding 100,000 ETH, new seigniorages will go to DAO's treasury.)

### Gaspool

Gaspool is a permissionless pool powered by APMM and deep learning algorithm, which is specially designed for the demands of Gas Token.

Today, the gas market is characterized by high volatility, lack of regularity, and likely to be manipulated. As the gas price of each block has its own distribution, it is extremely difficult to build a market for intertemporal gas trading. Thanks to deep learning algorithms, Gaswap is able to predict gas price of the next block and further adapt to and optimize this high volatility market through APMM.

## Product feature

### Trading

Unlike original PMM, Gaspool concentrates liquidity to the gas price. Users can simply interact with Gaspool to buy and sell Gas Token.
APMM is well adapted to this high volatility market. Specifically, the current gas price deviates greatly from the gas price of the previous block, i.e., when the marginal price deviates greatly from the gas price, the liquidity distribution of Gaspool will change, making liquidity less concentrated.

### LP and LM Program

As a permissionless protocol, anyone can add liquidity to become a market maker and earn liquidity mining rewards plus transaction fees. Liquidity providers will automatically mint LP NFTs which represent their positions. Further more, it’s very flexible for LPs to manage their capitals by rebalance mechanism.
**Note:** APMM is different from AMM, the marginal price is not consistent with the proportion of capital in the pool.

### Passive Hedging

Passive Hedging is defined as providing liquidity to gaspool for cost management. As the gas price may fluctuate up and down, the liquidity distribution varies accordingly. Hence we suggest to do passive hedges rather than make active interactions.

### Derivatives

In the long run, Gaswap will enable trading Gas Token perpetuals, options and other derivatives, e.g., gas token forward contract, for users to implement different trading strategies.

**Note:** Use at your own risk when using leverage.

## Algorithms

### **PMM**

The PMM algorithm has to answer how prices change according to inventory.

We observe two characteristics from the market.

1. Most of the liquidity is concentrated around the mid-market price, i.e., the price changes non-linearly with respect to the inventory.
2. There should be liquidity even if the price deviates far from the mid-market price, but it will be very scarce We therefore introduce a nonlinear term for the price curve to make the depth distribution more consistent with the market and more flexible.

### APMM

Inspired by DODO and Uniswap, Gaswap introduces a new algorithm - Asymmetirc Proactive Market Maker(APMM). APMM concentrates liquidity around the tracking price and adjusts liquidity distribution according to change between marginal gas price and tracking gas price.

When gas price fluctuates significantly, the liquidity on both sides of the tracking price will change, making the transaction liquidity asymmetric. For example, when the gas price rises sharply, from 10 gwei to 1000 gwei, it leads to a very thin left-side liquidity which increases slippage, whereas the right-side liquidity distribution becomes more concentrated which decreases slippage. But if it lasts a bit longer, then the liquidity distribution will be gradually concentrated around the gas price.

What the APMM algorithm needs to achieve is to change the liquidity distribution so that the gas token has a lower slippage when the price is stable, and a higher slippage when the gas price fluctuates significantly, so as to simulate the real gas market operation as much as possible. The purpose of this design is also to increase the cost of market manipulation. If a malicious attacker manipulates the tracking price of Gaspool, he must manipulate the real gas price for a long time.

When the tracking price drops sharply, the right-side liquidity is pretty thin and the left-side liquidity is more concentrated. At this time, the right-side slippage is high. As a buyer, the price change is large, and the transaction volume near this price will be relatively small. This makes it impossible for arbitrageurs and speculators to take advantage of market volatility to buy at low prices. The transactions concluded in this case are more of a bilateral buying and selling behavior of immediate transactions. Since the right-side liquidity distribution is extremely deviated from the tracking price, there will be less user interactions with the pool, which naturally protects LPs and reduces impermanent loss.

Similarly, when tracking price soars, the left-side liquidity is thin and the right-side liquidity is more concentrated which leads to asymmetric liquidity distribution.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9b93ee84-8307-4496-8b5e-0061f95750e5/Untitled.png)

However, when drastic price changes are transformed into a trend, the entire liquidity will gradually concentrate towards the tracking price. APMM will then monitor a continuous series of tracking prices, and when price fluctuations tend to be smoothed, former asymmetric liquidity will slowly convert to a more symmetric liquidity distribution.

### APMM-driven Gaspool

Gaswap leverages deep learning algorithms and mempool monitoring to predict the price of specific blockspace as a tracking price for concentrated liquidity. 

## Business Model

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/439f5094-4ab0-45c8-a653-295b8c1f873e/Untitled.png)

The entire business model is shown above. The revenue lies in the transaction fees and the seigniorages.

## Tokenomics

### Gas Token: GAS

Token distribution via:

1. Public Sale: according to data-driven specific demands, on a regular basis, vote by community;
2. Discount Private Sale: for institutional investors and market makers.

When Alice adds initial liquidity in a 1:1 ratio to the gaspool, GAS will be minted in terms of the current external gas price in the market, and a LP NFT position will be created for her as well. For example, Bob, who provides liquidity with 10 ETH at an external gas price = 20 gwei, will get a LP NFT that records gas price = 20 gwei, and when Bob withdraws his position at the same gas price, he gets 5 ETH and 5* 10^9 units of GAS. When liquidity is withdrawn at different gas prices, Bob will receive different proportions of ETH and GAS.

### Native token: GSP

**Utility:**
Governance: participate in decision-making process;
Real Yield: lock and earn 30% of protocol transaction fees and part of seigniorages;
Potential DAO incentives: retroactive airdrops to community contributors.

**Distribution:**
Team: 20% (1-year cliff, 3-year linear vesting)
Investor: 20% (1-year cliff, 2-year linear vesting)
Advisor: 7% (1-year cliff, 2-year linear vesting)
Public: 2% (Unlock at TGE)
Ecosystem: 50%
Insurance fund: 1%

### LP NFT

**LP NFT contains two key information of the position:**

1. External gas price
2. Token amounts

**LP NFT can be staked or burned:**

1. Burn: LP NFT will be burned after withdrawing liquidity, and impermanent loss will be realized;
2. Stake: Stake LP NFT to earn GSP token (there is a minimum lock period); 

After staking, user can either unlock or rebase their staked NFT:

1. Unlock: burn GSP to unlock;
2. Rebase: reset the external price parameters of LP NFT, and earn ETH/GAS refund.

**LP NFT Rebase**
User either gets ETH or GAS which depends on:

1. When external price > tracking price of LP NFT, get ETH;
2. When external price < tracking price of LP NFT, get GAS.

The rebase mechanism of LP NFT actually provides users with a convenient hedging solution that users can add a large amount of liquidity at one time, and then automatically get ETH or GAS rebase rewards.
